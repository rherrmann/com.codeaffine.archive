The Archive Utilities extend the Eclipse IDE to view the structure and content and extract zip archive files within the workspace. Zip-compatible archives like JARs, WARs, etc. are of course also supported.

This document is targeted at developers. For user documentation, pease read [this document](http://rherrmann.github.com/com.codeaffine.archive/index.html)

## Repository Contents

### Code 
The bundles `com.codeaffine.archive.contenttype` and `com.codeaffine.archive.ui` contain all the functionality.

### Tests
Each working code bundle has an accompanying fragment (with the suffix `.test`) that contains JUnit tests.
In addition, there are integration tests, located in the `com.codeaffine.archive.ui.itest` bundle. These depend on [SWTBot](http://eclipse.org/swtbot) and are also run as unit tests with JUnit.
Common helper and fixture code for all tests is in `com.codeaffine.archive.testfixture`.

The `com.codeaffine.archive.alltest` bundle contains a test suite that references all unit tests (not the integration tests) and should be used to run all tests from within the IDE.

### Target Platform
The `com.codeaffine.archive.releng` project contains [target platform](http://help.eclipse.org/indigo/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.pde.doc.user%2Fconcepts%2Ftarget.htm) definitions for the Eclipse versions used for development.

### Build
The `com.codeaffine.archive.releng` project contains everything that is necessary to build the software. The build is based on [Eclipse Tycho](http://www.eclipse.org/tycho). To run the build, change to the repostory's working directory and type

    ./mvnw -f com.codeaffine.archive.releng/pom.xml -Dbrowser=webkit clean verify 

The build uses the defalt target platform, currently `eclipse-4.12`. To specify a different target platform, add `-P <eclipse-platform>` to the command. &lt;eclipse-platform&gt; can be one of the target platform definitions in `com.codeaffine.archive.releng`.
